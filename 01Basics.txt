Rust is comipled language


Rust Installation -> "rustup" it is a cli tool  which manages versions of rust also add c comipler when installing rust

cmd -> rustc -V or rustc --version

cmd -> rustup update // update rust 
cmd -> rustup self uninstall // uninstall rust from machine
cmd -> rustup docs // this will gives a rust manual

Hello World  -> some points to remember extenstion (.rs)

fn main(){
    println!("Hello World");
}

how to execute -> similar to c, cpp, java
cmd -> rustc filename.rs
cmd -> ./filename


Note -> similar to c, cpp, java rust needs a main function to execute

cmd -> rustfmt filename.rs // this is a tool to format/refactor code accordingily similar to prettier 



Cargo -> It is a package manager
cmd -> cargo new projectName // this will creates a project structure just like cra,vite


toml{Toms Obvious Minimal Language} -> config file just like json, yaml
there is {Cargo.toml} where are config and dependencies are present.


## In rust package are known as "Crates"


cmd -> cargo build // this will generate exec files
we can run this file in "./target/debug/filename" //
but this is very hactic to goto that dir and run

cmd -> cargo run  // this manage two steps cargo build and run, auto defect wether there is change or not

cargo build or ca run also automatcally generates a top level Cargo.lock file which manages all info of project like dependencies similar to package-lock.json

cmd -> cargo check // this will check error

cargo by default build debug files that's why store in ./target/debug dir, so when project is ready use 

cmd -> cargo build --release // this is final code of project stores in "./target/release"
but this process is slower than cargo build or cargo run because it generates optimized code for production, so in development environment use cargo build or cargo run // use cargo run
