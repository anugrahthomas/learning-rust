'use' is used to import modules, crates, functions etc from other files or libraries
std -> it is standard library which comes with rust installation
example ->
use std::io; // importing io module from standard library for input output operations

cmd: cargo add -> it is used to add dependencies to Cargo.toml file [library crates]
cmd: cargo doc --open // this will open rust doc in browser

Variables -> let used to create variables 
variables are immutable in rust
let a = 32; 
but we can make them mutable by adding 'mut' keyword
let mut a = 32;

also we can make variable using const but this will never change, but we have to give type in case of const, in case of let it default gives a type i32
const a: u8 = 32;

const can be declared in any scope where local or global, but in case of let it is only local scope
